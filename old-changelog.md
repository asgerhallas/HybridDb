Changelog
=========

Note that later version are added as releases here on Github (https://github.com/asgerhallas/HybridDb/releases) and the changelog is available for each relase.

#### 0.8.3

- @afkpost added support for separate document metadata

#### 0.8.4

- @mookid8000 fixed issue #21

#### 0.8.5

- Added support for persisting anonynomous types
- Added support for persisting non-configured types in an always present Document table
- Added TypeMapper instead of requiring configuration for all concrete type manually

#### 0.9.0

- Changed the configuration api to accomodate ad hoc document setup. Now you need to call store.Initialize() after configuration to run the migrations.

#### 0.9.1

- Fixed issue with decimal-columns not having any scale. Now they are set to 28, 14.

#### 0.9.2

- Fixed issue with deadlocks while migrating schema in parallel test executing using temp tables
- Made deadlocks less likely for real tables too
- Changed id uniqueness in session to be table+key instead of type+key.

#### 0.9.3

- Added overload for DocumentStore.Create with configuration action

#### 0.9.4

- Added configuration option to set the default key resolver, which is used when trying to obtain an id from an entity in store.
- The default key resolver (if non other is set) now calls ToString() by default on the automatically resolved id from the stored entity. So if you use a Guid it will ToString it for you when you store.

#### 0.9.5

- Fixes issue #24
- Enforce store initialization before first session is opened
