HybridDb
========

HybridDb makes it easy to store and query semi-structured data and documents in SQL Server.

HybridDb gives you:

- A unit of work API similar to NHibernate or RavenDB
- Easy schemaless and mostly mappingless persistance of any .NET object
- A few simple indexing features that enables querying on document properties
- A LINQ provider for mentioned queries
- All the consistency and transactionality of a relational database
- Migration tools for document changes and index changes

HybridDb aims to be a small and focused library with no magic and no surprises.

So if all you need is to put some JSON to rest - on a single server, in simple manner - HybridDb might be the tool for you.

Why?
====

We have been happy users of the [awesome RavenDB](http://ravendb.net/) for a quite a while,
but we ran into some performance issues that we were not able to dodge ([read more here](https://groups.google.com/d/topic/ravendb/6NjiJpzYxyI/discussion)).

With no solution to the problem in sight - and in the lucky situation that we did not rely on any of RavenDB's more advanced features - we decided to write a drop-in replacement to run on top of SQL Server.

HybridDb is the result of this effort and fulfills our modest requirements - and we hope it can be useful for others too.

How?
====

Like this:

    var store = DocumentStore.ForTesting(TableMode.TempTables);
    store.Document<Entity>().With(x => x.Property);

    using (var session = store.OpenSession())
    {
        session.Store(new Entity { Id = Guid.NewGuid(), Property = 2001, Field = "Hello" });
        session.SaveChanges();
    }

    using (var session = store.OpenSession())
    {
        var entity = session.Query<Entity>().Single(x => x.Property > 2000);
        entity.Property++;
        session.SaveChanges();
    }

================

HybridDb uses [Dapper](http://code.google.com/p/dapper-dot-net/), [Json.NET](http://http://json.net/) and [Inflector](https://github.com/srkirkland/Inflector) ... all of which are brilliant pieces of open source software.

Code for managing anonymous objects is taken [from here](http://blog.andreloker.de/post/2008/05/03/Anonymous-type-to-dictionary-using-DynamicMethod.aspx)

[NHibernate](http://nhforge.org/) and [RavenDB](http://ravendb.net/) has been our role models.

So that's it... HybridDb is standing on the shoulder of giants. And it can't get down.
